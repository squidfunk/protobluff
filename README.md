# protobluff

protobluff is a modular Protocol Buffers implementation for C.

## Theory of Operation

[Protocol Buffers][] is a language-neutral, platform-neutral and extensible
message format developed by Google for serializing structured data. It uses
schema files to describe the structure of messages, which are in turn used to
generate language-specific bindings to automatically handle the decoding and
encoding for the developer. However, as messages can have a variable amount
of repeated submessages and fields, decoding and encoding may involve a large
number of scattered allocations which in turn is not very cache-friendly.

protobluff follows a different approach. It entirely skips the necessary
decoding and encoding steps when reading or writing values from messages,
as it directly operates on the encoded data. New values can be incrementally
read or written, memory management is centralized and handled by the underlying
journal. If no alterations that change the size of the underlying journal are
expected, the journal can be used in *zero-copy mode*, omitting all dynamic
allocations.

## Installation

### Building from source

protobluff is built using [Autotools][] and can be linked as a static or shared
library. It has no runtime dependencies and is fully self-contained, except for
the code generator which depends on the original Protocol Buffers library and
is necessary to generate bindings from `.proto` schema files. If the original
library is not available, the generator is not built. The following commands
build and install the protobluff library and code generator:

``` sh
./autogen.sh &&
./configure &&
make &&
make test &&
make install
```

protobluff should compile and run on all UNIX systems (including Linux and Mac
OS) as it adheres to the C99 and C++98 standards and does not make use of any
system-specific functionality.

After installing protobluff, the code generator can be used to generate
bindings from `.proto` schema files to get started. See
[this section](#using-the-code-generator) for more information.

### Additional options

By default, protobluff is compiled aggressively optimized with `-O3` and some
further optimizations which make it nearly impossible to debug. If debugging
is necessary, one should disable optimizations. Stripped compilation will
remove all symbols that are not defined in the public header files, allowing
further optimizations. Enabling the coverage report is only necessary to
determine unit test coverage, and thus only needed during development.

``` sh
./configure
  --disable-optimized # No optimizations (default: enabled)
  --enable-stripped   # Strip internal symbols (default: disabled)
  --enable-coverage   # Coverage report (default: disabled)
```

The tests can only be built if stripped compilation is not enabled, as no
internal symbols would be visible to the unit tests.

## Using the code generator

The code generator is tightly integrated with the protoc compiler toolchain
included in the default Protocol Buffers distribution. Use the `protoc` command
to invoke the protobluff code generator through the `--protobluff_out` flag,
to generate and write the respective `.pb.c` and `.pb.h` files to a specific
location:

``` sh
protoc --protobluff_out=. *.proto
```

The `.pb.h` header files will contain the bindings, the `.pb.c` source files
contain the descriptor definitions which are referenced by the bindings.
Therefore, the source files must be compiled together with your project.

## Using the generated bindings

Here's a usage example taken from the original description of the Google
Protocol Buffers library and adapted to protobluff:

``` c
/* Create an empty journal to assemble a new person message */
pb_journal_t journal = pb_journal_create_empty();

/* Create a person message */
pb_message_t person = person_create(&journal);

/* Define the values we want to set */
pb_string_t name   = pb_string_init_from_chars("John Doe"),
            email  = pb_string_init_from_chars("jdoe@example.com"),
            home   = pb_string_init_from_chars("+1-541-754-3010"),
            mobile = pb_string_init_from_chars("+1-541-293-8228");
int32_t     id     = 1234;

/* Set values on person message and check return codes */
pb_error_t error = PB_ERROR_NONE;
do {
  if ((error = person_put_name(&person, &name)) ||
      (error = person_put_id(&person, &id)) ||
      (error = person_put_email(&person, &email)))
    break;

  /* Set home number */
  pb_message_t phone1 = person_create_phone(&person);
  if (!(error = person_phonenumber_put_number(&phone1, &home)) &&
      !(error = person_phonenumber_put_type_home(&phone1))) {

    /* Set mobile number */
    pb_message_t phone2 = person_create_phone(&person);
    if (!(error = person_phonenumber_put_number(&phone2, &mobile)) &&
        !(error = person_phonenumber_put_type_mobile(&phone2))) {

      /* Dump the journal */
      pb_journal_dump(&journal);

      /* The encoded message can be accessed as follows */
      // const uint8_t *data = pb_journal_data(&journal);
      // const size_t   size = pb_journal_size(&journal);
    }
    person_phonenumber_destroy(&phone2);
  }
  person_phonenumber_destroy(&phone1);
} while (0);

/* Print error, if any */
if (error)
  fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: %s\n", pb_error_string(error));

/* Cleanup and invalidate */
person_destroy(&person);

/* Free all allocated memory and return */
pb_journal_destroy(&journal);
return error
  ? EXIT_FAILURE
  : EXIT_SUCCESS;
```

See the examples directory for more information.

## Linking

### Manually

For the generated bindings to function, your project must be linked against the
protobluff runtime. The recommended way is to dynamically link the shared
library. Therefore, the following compiler and linker flags must be obtained
and added to your build toolchain:

``` sh
pkg-config --cflags protobluff # Add output to compiler flags
pkg-config --libs   protobluff # Add output to linker flags
```

### Autotools

If you're using Autotools, the `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` macro will take care of the
heavy lifting. Adding the following line to your `configure.ac` file will place
the compiler flags into the variable `protobluff_CFLAGS` and the linker flags
into the variable `protobluff_LDFLAGS`:

``` makefile
PKG_CHECK_MODULES([protobluff], [protobluff])
```

## Features

### Already supported

1. Message definitions
2. Nested submessage definitions
3. All scalar types
4. Enumerations
5. Strings and binaries
6. Optional, required and repeated fields
7. Imports
8. Packages
9. Extensions and nested extensions
10. Deprecations for messages, fields, enums and enum values
11. Packed fields
12. Oneofs

### Not (yet) supported

1. proto3 support
2. Services (using gRPC and/or ZMQ)
3. Groups (unsure)

protobluff is basically compatible with proto3, as proto2 is binary compatible,
but some special types like maps and the `Any` type need to be implemented.
